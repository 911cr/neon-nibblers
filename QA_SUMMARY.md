# Revision 5 review and QA status

Ten separate topic agents completed an initial research audit, then the same agents performed two QA passes. Reproducible failures were fixed and the relevant agents rechecked them. No agent certified a perfect commercial match. Final targeted reviews report no remaining reproduced blocking failures in their scopes; reference uncertainties remain open.

| Topic | QA outcome / fixes |
|---|---|
| Player interactions | Fixed head-on crossing, cooldown overlaps, eight-player crowds and delayed bonus life; targeted recheck passed |
| Gates | Twin contours, hatch alignment and crossing state; stale stun/clock cleared; 32 gate scenarios passed |
| Power inventory | All11 categories/icons/labels/guide rows checked; stale descriptions corrected |
| Power effects | 14 focused runtime cases plus slowdown/stacking checks passed; unsupported exact ranges/timings remain open |
| Power placement/cadence | 16 scenario groups and4400 occupied-cell-safe spawn cases; clocks reset; cadence explicitly custom |
| Edges/tunnels | 32 player seam scenarios/512frames and16 collectible scenarios/256frames; opacity/giant thresholds/HUD clipping fixed |
| Walls | All-map connectivity/visible routes and giant/corner stress renders passed; authored topology still differs |
| Ghost starts | 12 count/map configurations checked; staging/reset valid, exact original order unknown |
| Ghost exits | 16 direct cases and48 repeated lifecycle cycles; visible doorway return fixed |
| Player/ghost/powers | Eight scenario groups; expired/dead-owner weapons and safe hunter eating fixed |

The integrated headless suite passes25 tests. Native Windows1/2/8-player autoplay and regenerated recordings use the revised build. Physical USB controllers/eight humans and native Linux graphics/audio remain unverified. Linux CI is a headless software check, not hardware validation.

Detailed audit notes are in docs/audits. Some earlier sections describe old bugs and failed intermediate versions; later QA and resolution sections record the fixes. Open GitHub issues separate remaining evidence gaps from verified implementation behavior.

## Revision 6 follow-up

New promotional-poster evidence corrected coffee-mug, quake-plunger, blue-magnet, flaming-pepper, white1UP and shaded-orb artwork. The inventory reviewer checked all11 guide icons for readability/clipping and confirmed improved silhouettes. A released Deluxe video showed yellow gate hatching on cyan mazes, correcting the earlier theme-color inference; the gate reviewer verified the new four-theme pixel test.

27 tests now pass on local Windows and Ubuntu. Actual Ubuntu X11/audio-initialized1/2/8 runs completed. Physical devices detected:0; controller verification cannot pass without hardware. No agentcertifiedexactcommercialart/rules.

## Revision 7 controller acceptance scope

The user authorizes assumed controller availability during development and requires real missing/disconnect detection in production. App defaults to real detection. Dedicated development launchers pass --simulate-controllers and visibly label the assumed count. No fake input devices are created; keyboard and autoplay remain available. Production hardware validation is deferred, not falsely marked passed.

Two targeted QA passes checked zero/partial/full counts, hotplug, fallback and text layout. Fixed stale reconnect warning and added regression assertion. Current integrated suite:29 tests.


## Revision 8

Three focused agents performed research/code review followed by deeper adversarial passes and fix rechecks.63 total tests cover original rules, explicit maps, score/replay and independent stations. Found/fixed autoplay dot deletion without scoring, wrong-station controller availability, top-bay locator clipping and an intermediate three-outline house rendering mistake. The final house check counts actual visible contours. Source evidence, differences and next actions are maintained in the seven DX documents. Native Windows/WSLg1/2/8 runs completed; updated clips are actual simulated gameplay. No exact-DX or physical-hardware certification.


## Revision 9 — 2026-11-08

Fixed scores/lives/start prompts overlapping gate bounds, including giant locator clearance and long score values. Cyan Circuit map revision2 opens the continuous house perimeter and separates two nearby vertical wall sections, informed by real DX footage at75/120seconds after180-degree orientation normalization. Exact coordinates remain estimated and the full DX topology is still unresolved.

Preserved movement timer remainders and boundary precision: normal movement now10cells/s, caffeine15 and banana18 under the configured approximation, versus8/15/15 previously. Damage cues now follow damage events even when another player earns a life simultaneously. Lightning ignores inactive stations.

72 tests pass locally on Windows and Ubuntu. New native300-frame1/2/8 runs used real Windows/X11 drivers; Windows58.39/60.27/59.93FPS; UbuntuWSLg34.49/33.64/45.20FPS under concurrent capture load. Physical controllers remain deferred. Three agents performed reference/code reviews, deeper QA and rechecks. No perfect-match claim.

The separate1/2/8-player clips now show corrected Cyan Circuit,12seconds each; the montage covers allfourmaps. `hud_before_after_r9.png` and `map_before_after_r9.png` are controlled local before/after comparisons. A new reference-only figure outside the gameZIP records actual footage observations. Replay sample regenerated after timing changes.


## Revision 10 — all-map review and simultaneous interactions

Reviewed all four authored maps against retained real DX75/120second frames. The footage does not establish four complete DX layouts; a fresh viewing attempt was stopped by browser URL-verification policy. No unsupported geometry changes were made. Every map already has a continuous house perimeter; the catalog now validates those routes and door approaches. Broad wall interiors have an inset contour based on the visible rectangular-island style; application to broad L-shaped walls remains an explicit visual approximation. No floor, frame, gate or house-outline pixels changed in the comparative render QA. See audits/revision10_all_maps.md for the four-row evidence matrix.

Fixed lightning outcomes depending on station order, tiny floating-point power/safety expiration tails, roaming collectibles not collecting on stationary/stunned players, and same-tick bonus credit after that contact. Added ten original layered event cues on separate channels. Mute stops active cues immediately; unavailable audio is handled gracefully. Sounds are synthesized locally, not commercial recordings. Audible speaker quality and physical controllers remain unverified/deferred.

92 automated tests pass locally on Windows and Ubuntu. Actual native1/2/8 rendering runs now cover all four maps (12 short120-frame scenarios on each OS). These are startup/render samples, not benchmarks or human gameplay certification. The supplied1/2/8-player GIFs each show four separate seeded6-second map scenarios (24seconds total); they do not assert that the commercial game uses that stage sequence. All game GIFs are silent. sound_preview.wav demonstrates the original cues.

Source, event replay and captured gameplay were regenerated after the simulation fixes. Complete commercial geometry, exact scoring/timing/AI, stage transitions, joining windows, attract/operator and spectator behavior remain open evidence/work items. Physical controller acceptance stays in production.


## Revision 11 — animation, proportions and fresh DX reference review

Fresh real DX footage was viewed safely through normal browser navigation after using a new tab with a verified address. New60/65/124/135second research captures and the report are recorded in audits/revision11_reference.md; camera edits/glare prevent exact cycle timing and a complete commercial map catalog. Distinct house-side geometry appears with the same cyan palette. Palette selection is now independent of layout: F12 cycles wall colors during play, or use `--palette 0..3`. This changes presentation only, not match logic or routes; default progression remains our approximation.

Fixed the left-facing eye/light flip, missing individual ghost stun feedback and tunnel copies, sorted-item animation identity jumps, short respawn/stage cache slides, and animation continuing during pause/guide/results. All11 power icons now use cached3x procedural artwork and position-independent bob phase. Fire is a continuous layered animated plume with a pale core, clipped to reachable corridor endpoints and split correctly at tunnels. Lightning arcs animate. Exact DX art proportions and timing are still unverified.

110 tests cover artwork/time samples, direction, icon sizes16–96px, ghost states, HUD/tunnels, effects, pause/results, respawn, item tracking,720/1080 resizing and palette changes without logic mutation. Two agent QA passes included discovered clipping and freeze regressions followed by corrections. Native1/2/8 render samples cover every map on Windows and Ubuntu/WSLg. These are short graphics checks, not hardware or performance certification; the final plume styling is also checked by the final render suite and recordings. Physical controllers remain deferred to production.

Each1/2/8-player GIF tours four separate6-second map scenarios (24seconds,288frames). New `gameplay_1_player.mp4`, `gameplay_2_player.mp4` and `gameplay_8_player.mp4` show the same tour at1280x720/60fps with original event audio, avoiding GIF color/frame-rate limits. They are actual computer-controlled game simulations. They do not prove a commercial stage sequence or physical-input compatibility.

Optional recording tools: `python -m pip install -r requirements-capture.txt`, then `python record_video.py --players 8 --seconds 6`. They are unnecessary for playing. Native Windows encoding was tested; playback files can be viewed on Windows/Linux with an H.264/AAC player. The game remains Python/Pygame source, not a standalone executable.

See animation_contact_r11.png, animation_review_r11.gif, fire_animation_r11.png and animation_world_effects.png for tested frame sequences and sizes. The matrices document finite reviewed cases; no exhaustive or perfect-commercial-match claim is made. Full DX topology, scoring/timing/AI, death/growth transitions and operator/spectator/attract systems remain unfinished.


## Revision 12 — reconstructed layouts and cabinet lifecycle

Current production routes are independently reconstructed from two full DX spectator views at68/73seconds in the IAAPA2022 source. All four color profiles use these two families; unsupported authored routes are retired. Quantization and glare-hidden endpoints remain approximate; no complete commercial catalog or pixel identity is certified. Ghost house paths, tunnels and bays now derive from each profile's geometry. Actual-width render checks caught and fixed erased wall stems, and new bay positions required a dynamic central HUD clearance fix.

AI actors were observed alongside join prompts. Vacant stations now have configurable AI opponents; human counts, controls, credits and rankings remain distinct. Human takeover resets bot scores, carried weapons and growth; eliminated humans cannot revive through Start. All-human elimination ends a match even if bots survive. Exact DX difficulty/replacement rules remain unknown.

Implemented smooth growth/shrink, death dissolve, bay arrival feedback, saved operator settings, credits/free play, persistent local human scores with failure retry, original idle instructional/high-score attract pages and optional spectator mirrors/ranking windows. Their detailed UI/timing are original adaptations. Native game+spectator pairs ran on Windows and Ubuntu/WSLg.

151 tests pass locally on both OS environments. Twelve complete automated human/AI matches ended with reconciled event totals and human-only rankings; native1/2/8 checks cover all four profiles on both systems. Physical controllers remain deferred to production. Current recordings use1/2/8 logical human slots with7/6/0 AI opponents; all actors are computer-controlled during capture.

Current acceptance/evidence boundaries are in DX_RELEASE_STATUS.md. Software features are implemented and tested; exact commercial score/multiplier values, timings, AI, joining/progression rules, full map inventory and overhead content by state remain unverified. Open evidence issues are not administratively closed to claim completion.


## Revision 13 — source measurements, rounded walls and scoring/AI corrections

Fresh confirmed DX footage43DcDXxEgzk was reviewed at quarter speed and paused positions. At9:22 red144640 has four ordinary dots ahead; at9:23 the corridor is cleared and score144680. This OBSERVED DX aggregate supports10 per ordinary dot; it does not recover other score awards or multipliers. At9:23–9:34 the final-life station displays CONTINUE/COIN while AI moves, followed by alphabet/name entry by9:45. No purchased continue, restored-life policy or score retention was observed. The fresh red full-board9:34 is independently identified as existing family A, corroborating color/layout independence, not adding a third maze. Candidate power sequences were rejected as exact duration measurements because of refreshes, occlusion and transition ambiguity. See audits/revision13_reference.md.

Rounded capsule ends and convex branch corners now retain narrow stems and the same validated corridor graph. Removed a faint third house underlay contour; actual-App scans require exactly two house borders on all four profiles. New comparison research images remain outside the runnable package. Exact20px quantization/hidden endpoints, source widths, full commercial catalog and progression remain unverified.

Corrected ledger totals after bot-to-human takeover: historical bot awards remain recorded, while station_join starts the new score account at zero. HUD, spectator rankings and ledger agree. Tested simultaneous dot/power/ghost/rival/bonus awards, duplicate fire attackers, expiry contact, carried ownership and same-tick damage. Bot routing now uses deterministic weighted legal paths, avoiding nearby lethal ghosts/giants/carried rival weapons and actively seeking capturable ghosts with Magnet. This improves our original strategy; exact DX difficulty/targeting remains unknown.

Power durations, movement intervals, ranges, slowdown multipliers and item cadence/cap are now validated per-Match tuning settings, loadable with --tuning tuning.example.json. Complete effective values and pickup duration/nominal expiry are captured in event logs/replays; quickstart and station START honor the same settings. Existing numerical defaults remain explicitly approximate. The on-screen guide reflects effective durations.

Added optional --untimed life-survival mode, also operator time limit0. Default180s remains an explicit custom score-attack mode, not a certified DX limit. Untimed progression, pause, elimination, spectator labels and replay are covered; CLI mode overrides do not silently rewrite saved operator settings. Exact final-life continue interval and background AI before original name entry remain a known presentation/behavior difference; no invented paid-continue policy is claimed.

Results now offer N for original three-letter initials for this session's qualifying top20 human rows. Atomic renaming uses session/player identity, protecting ties and historical/legacy rows. Failed writes roll back; cancelling discards only the active draft. Immediate replay and pending score-save retries remain intact. Exact cabinet entry UI, timeout and physical-controller entry are not reproduced or certified.

Final validation:187 tests passed on Windows and Ubuntu/WSLg, with source-frozen extracted-ZIP verification recorded separately. Native1/2/8 runs cover every profile on both systems, plus actual game/spectator pairs with audio initialization. Twelve complete automated human/AI matches reconcile ledger totals and rankings. Three48-second1280x720/60fps MP4s with original AAC event audio fully decode;24-second GIF previews and12-frame profile/count contact sheet were checked. All recording actors are automated; logical1/2/8 human stations have7/6/0 AI. Physical controllers, human multiplayer acceptance and audible speaker assessment stay in production.

Agent reviews ran initial and deeper passes with targeted fixes/rechecks. Their approval covers tested implementation scope, not undocumented original rules. Remaining exact scoring/power/AI/map/continue questions are tracked honestly; no perfect-match or zero-issues claim.
